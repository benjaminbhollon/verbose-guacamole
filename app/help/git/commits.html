        <p>Verbose Guacamole uses Git, version control software originally designed for keeping track of changes to code. As such, Git has high performance and allows integration with a multitude of tools.</p>
        <p>The most important feature of Git, from the standpoint of a writer using Verbose Guacamole, is the <strong>commit</strong>. A commit is a set of changes that you save that you can refer back to it later. Think of it as a saved copy of an older version.</p>
        <p>To create a commit, type a short description of what you changed (a <strong>commit message</strong>) in the box labelled "Commit message" and click "Commit".</p>
        <p>In coding, commit messages are traditionally written in an imperative mood (for example, "Draft scene about Winnie-the-Pooh" rather than "Winnie-the-Pooh" or "Drafted new scene"), so bonus points if you can get that in! The reason for this is that a commit is not really a saved version of a file but a set of changes from the previous commit, and the commit message describes what action is performed on the previous version to get the form represented by the commit. If you don't feel like writing commit messages in an imperative mood, no need, but it's a fun way to honor the roots from whence Verbose Guacamole came (i.e. Git)! It is, though, a good idea to try to write commit messages that are unique so you can tell them apart.</p>
        <p>In the future, Verbose Guacamole will have a feature to allow you to view what your project looked like in past commits and even to restore your project to a past commit.</p>
        <p>A feature already possible for people who know how to use Git is to set up a remote repository to sync your changes between devices. A guide for this as well as built in features will come soon.</p>
