        <p>Verbose Guacamole uses Git, a version control software originally designed for keeping track of changes to computer code. As such, Git has powerful performance and allows integration with a multitude of tools.</p>
        <p>The most important feature of Git, from the standpoint of a writer using Verbose Guacamole, is the <strong>commit</strong> functionality. A commit is a set of changes that you save that you can refer back to it later. Think of it as a saved copy of an older version.</p>
        <p>To create a commit, type a short description of what you changed (a <strong>commit message</strong>) in the box labelled "Commit message" and click "Commit".</p>
        <p>It is typically a good idea to try to write commit messages that are unique so you can tell them apart.</p>
        <p>A feature already possible for people who know how to use Git is to set up a remote repository to sync your changes between devices. A guide for this as well as built in features will come soon.</p>
